## CS-201 Day 1

What is the difference between R and RStudio?

## Running Code

Try running some code

```{r}
1 + 1
1 + 87
0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3

options(scipen = 999)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
